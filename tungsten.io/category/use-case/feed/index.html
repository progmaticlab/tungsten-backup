										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<link rel="canonical" href="https://codilime.com/blog/deploying-a-kubernetes-operator-in-openshift-4-x-platform">


<p><em><strong>This is a contributed blog from LF Networking Member CodiLime.&nbsp;<a href="https://codilime.com/blog/deploying-a-kubernetes-operator-in-openshift-4-x-platform" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Originally published here</a></strong>.</em></p>



<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/Juniper/contrail-operator">Contrail-operator</a>&nbsp;is a recently released open-source Kubernetes operator that implements Tungsten Fabric&nbsp; as a custom resource. Tungsten Fabric is an open-source Kubernetes-compatible, network virtualization solution for providing connectivity and security for virtual, containerized or bare-metal workloads. An operator needed to be adjusted to the OpenShift 4.x platform, which introduced numerous changes to its architecture compared with previous versions. In this blog post, you’ll read about three interesting use cases and their solutions. All of these solutions are a part of&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/Juniper/contrail-operator/tree/master/deploy/openshift">contrail-operator public repository</a>.</strong></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Use case 1: inject kernel in CoreOS with OverlayFS</h2>



<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenShift">OpenShift</a>&nbsp;is a container platform designed by Red Hat. Its version 4.x is based on nodes that use&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Container_Linux">CoreOS</a>, an open-source operating system based on the Linux kernel. CoreOS has been designed specifically to allow changes in the system only when booting it for the first time. These changes are introduced using ignition configs—JSON files containing, for example, names of services, files or users to be created. When the OS is up and running, most of its settings can be seen in read-only mode and users are not allowed to modify system settings.</p>



<p>The setup is presented in Figure 1:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/c03564453aee495e0696081960dd4ff0399cbc73/dff79/img/codilime_desired_deployment_of_tf_with_an_openshift_setup.png" alt="Deployment of Tungsten Fabric with an Openshift setup"/></figure>



<p><strong>Fig 1. The desired deployment of Tungsten Fabric with an OpenShift setup</strong></p>



<p>In Tungsten Fabric, vRouter is injected into the system as a kernel module. In the contrail-operator (and also in the&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/tungstenfabric/tf-ansible-deployer">tf-ansible-deployer</a>, effectively the operator’s predecessor) this is done by launching a container that injects this module into the system. With OpenShift, this task is handled by daemonSet, which launches a pod on every node. In such a pod, one of the initContainers (i.e. containers launched to perform a given operation only once and then shut down, thus allowing the proper containers to be launched) injects the kernel module into the system. Yet given the characteristics of the CoreOS, this operation cannot be performed because a container will inject a read-only kernel module to /lib/modules.</p>



<p>Enter the solution to this challenge: overlayFS, which virtually merges the two directories:/lib/modules (read only) and /opt/modules (writable). Ignition config is now created, which will set OverlayFS /lib/modules with /opt/modules directories. The latter was accessible and it was possible to inject a kernel module there (see Figure 2). Such a solution did not make any difference from the perspective of the Tungsten Fabric Controller. Hence, it was not necessary to change anything in TF itself.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/69eb2300a7ad4c2deafbe9ef00fd48a64557b067/b684f/img/codilime_overlayfs_of_two_directories.png" alt="The OverlayFS of two directories"/></figure>



<p><strong>Fig. 2 The OverlayFS of two directories</strong></p>



<p>Ignition config looks like this:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>apiVersion: machineconfiguration.openshift.io/v1
kind: MachineConfig
metadata:
 labels:
   machineconfiguration.openshift.io/role: master
 name: 02-master-modules
spec:
 config:
   ignition:
     version: 2.2.0
   storage:
     directories:
       - filesystem: "root"
         path: "/opt/modules"
         mode: 0755
       - filesystem: "root"
         path: "/opt/modules.wd"
         mode: 0755
     files:
       - filesystem: "root"
         path: "/etc/fstab"
         mode: 0644
         contents:
           source: "data:,overlay%20/lib/modules%20overlay%20lowerdir=/lib/modules,upperdir=/opt/modules,workdir=/opt/modules.wd%200%200"</code></pre>



<p>Source:&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/Juniper/contrail-operator/blob/master/deploy/openshift/openshift/99_master-kernel-modules-overlay.yaml">GitHub</a></p>



<p>Ignition config creates two directories: /opt/modules, to inject modules, and /opt/modules.wd, a working directory. Next, in the /etc/fstab, the mount is defined:</p>



<p><code>overlay /lib/modules overlay lowerdir=/lib/modules,upperdir=/opt/modules,workdir=/opt/modules.wd</code></p>



<p>Interestingly, it is not a typical ignition config for CoreOS, but a custom resource from an OpenShift cluster—MachineConfig. It performs the same functions as ignition config but is also visible as a cluster resource and allows you to edit the config when the cluster is running. In this way, you can apply changes to the CoreOS node even after first boot, which is not usually supported by standard CoreOS-based deployments. This is a feature specific to OpenShift.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Use case 2: set nftables rules of CoreOS with ignition config</h2>



<p>CoreOS uses nftables, a newer framework for packet management than iptables. With a normal system like RHEL8, this is still an iptables command-line tool but in its backend it uses nftables. The iptables syntax is converted into respective nftables commands in the backend, so you can still use classic iptables commands and nftables will be still properly configured. Of course, in the CoreOS there is no such tool as iptables, as nobody assumes that the rules for packet handling will be changed when the system is up and running.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is true that in one of the initContainers located in a vRouter configuration pod, an iptables tool is used to carry out several operations. But the container is based on RHEL7 which in turn uses iptables backend. It is worth noting that a CLI iptables tool can support backend with iptables or nftables, though this depends on the system’s backend in which it was compiled.</p>



<p>To check what backend is used by iptables (CLI), just write the following command:&nbsp;<code>iptables --version</code>. If&nbsp;<code>(nftables)</code>&nbsp;is the reply, the tool supports nftables backend. If there is no such reply, it means that the tool supports iptables backend.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Meanwhile, a container had a version without nftables, so it was impossible to establish rules using a container. Ignition configs helped solve this challenge. During the system boot, rules can be established using a native iptables tool:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>apiVersion: machineconfiguration.openshift.io/v1
kind: MachineConfig
metadata:
 labels:
   machineconfiguration.openshift.io/role: master
 name: 10-master-iptables

         StandardError=syslog
 
         &#91;Install]
         WantedBy=basic.target
   storage:
     files:
     - filesystem: root
       path: /blog/etc/contrail/iptables_script.sh
       mode: 0744
       user:
         name: root
       contents:
         # 'data:,' and URL encoded openshift-install/sources/iptables_script.sh
         source: data:...,</code></pre>



<p>The full version of the code can be found on&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/Juniper/contrail-operator/blob/master/deploy/openshift/openshift/99_worker-iptables-machine-config.yaml">GitHub</a>.</p>



<p>In this config a service is created and run as a oneshot script during the system boot. The script is then created on the path:&nbsp;<code>/etc/contrail/iptables_script.sh</code>. The full version of the script is available in the&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/Juniper/contrail-operator/blob/master/deploy/openshift/sources/iptables_script.sh">GitHub repository</a>. Generally speaking, these are simple iptables commands setting up the resources needed to run Tungsten Fabric.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Use case 3: why namespaced owner orphans cluster resource</h2>



<p>The last use case concerns the implementation of Kubernetes. During the tests one of the child resources was constantly being deleted, for no apparent reason. An investigation revealed the source of the problem: Owner reference is set for resources like Persistent Volume and Storage Class. According to the&nbsp;<a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/garbage-collection/">Kubernetes documentation</a>:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><em>Cross-namespace owner references are disallowed by design. This means that namespace-scoped dependents can only specify owners in the same namespace, and owners that are cluster-scoped. Cluster-scoped dependents can only specify cluster-scoped owners, but not namespace-scoped owners.</em></p></blockquote>



<p>So owner reference for Persistent Volume and Storage Class (both cluster-wide resources) was set for a namespaced resource. That was why the garbage collector in Kubernetes kept deleting the entire component. Garbage collector saw that the cluster-scoped resource had set the owner and tried to find it only in cluster-scoped resources. However, the owner was hidden in the namespace. As a result, the garbage collector recognized the resource as orphaned and deleted it in order to keep the cluster clean.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/62e099a3e5dd426221a23e4078597d92919738fb/37e61/img/codilime_namespace_owner.png" alt="MY RESOURCE can be the owner only of another resource in its namespace but not in a different namespace (cluster-scoped resource)"/></figure>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>By Sukhdev Kapur</h4>
<p>The rollout of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5G">5G</a> is a technological disruption for telecom and technology business players. This requires management of real time data flows, with central control, between various <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edge_device">edge</a> and core deployments. In order to minimize the latency, 5G and IoT deployments require compute power to move toward the edge, closer to the end-users and devices that produce or consume the real time data.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software-defined_networking">SDN</a> controllers are proven to manage such workloads in telco as well as enterprise deployments. In this article, we discuss the SDN stack <a href="https://tungsten.io">Tungsten Fabric</a> and how it can be used for 5G networks and an edge cloud that is based upon <a href="https://www.lfedge.org/projects/akraino/">Akraino Edge Stack</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://tungsten.io/">Tungsten Fabric</a> (AKA &#8216;TF&#8217;) is an open source SDN project in the <a href="https://www.lfnetworking.org">LF Networking</a> initiative. TF provides a single point of control, visibility, and management for networking &amp; security for different types of data center deployments or clouds. It has taken SDN technology to next level by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Providing consistent network functionality and enforcing security policies for different types of workloads (virtual machines, containers, bare metal) orchestrated with different available orchestrators (OpenStack, Kubernetes, VMware , etc)</li>
<li>Providing production grade networking &amp; security stack for Data Center and Public Clouds (AWS, Azure, GCP) &amp; Edge cloud deployments</li>
</ul>
<p>Tungsten Fabric evolved as a network software stack for providing an SDN solution for Telco Cloud and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_function_virtualization">NFV</a> use cases.</p>
<h3>Tungsten Fabric Integration with Akraino Edge Cloud</h3>
<p>TF, by integrating with <a href="https://www.lfedge.org/projects/akraino/">Akraino Edge Stack</a>, can act as unified SDN controller to enhance many features for 5G core and edge nodes, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Enabling distributed edge computing using TF remote compute architecture</li>
<li>A common SDN controller for different workloads in network cloud i.e. CNF, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_function_virtualization">VNF</a>, PNFs (Containerized, Virtual, and Physical Network Functions)</li>
<li>Service chaining at different types of edge sites or clouds (public or private)</li>
<li>Common security policy enforcement for all nodes</li>
<li>Advanced networking performance features: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-root_input/output_virtualization">SR/IOV</a>, <a href="https://www.dpdk.org">DPDK</a>, BGP-VPN, IPSec/TLS Support, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>OpenContrail has solidified its position as the top SDN and network automation solution for <a href="https://www.openstack.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">OpenStack</a>, and <a href="http://www.opencontrail.org/the-best-sdn-for-openstack-now-for-kubernetes/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">recently announced</a> it&#8217;s integration into <a href="https://kubernetes.io/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Kubernetes (K8s)</a> and thus <a href="https://www.openshift.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">OpenShift</a> (recent versions are powered by Kubernetes.) What does this mean for the organization mapping out their cloud infrastructure architecture?</p>
<h3>VMware -&gt; OpenStack -&gt; Kubernetes</h3>
<p>At this juncture in cloud adoption, service providers and enterprises alike are defining their ever evolving stacks. The emergence of containers has changed the game &#8211; changing the conversation from &#8220;OpenStack or Kubernetes?&#8221; to &#8220;OpenStack and Kubernetes.&#8221; In many cases VMware is still in the mix somewhere. The combination of these platforms allows an organization to select the best hosting platform for each workload, based on it&#8217;s own unique characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Aging monolithic application that will be deprecated in the next few years? Keep it where it is (VMware.)</li>
<li>Distributed multi-tier web app? Perhaps OpenStack is a good candidate.</li>
<li>Highly variable, net new microservices based application(s) &#8211; Kubernetes will allow the individual microservices to scale up and down independently of one another.</li>
</ul>
<p>While all of this choice provides flexibility, it introduces complexity &#8211; especially on the network with each of the three platforms with three different networking stacks.</p>
<h3>How Contrail enables Successful Cloud Adoption</h3>
<p>Introducing Contrail into a heterogeneous cloud/virtualization environment will help an organization move towards SDN adoption based on open standards. One SDN solution to manage them all! Furthermore, it isn&#8217;t realistic or likely for an organization to go from VMware to OpenStack to Kubernetes all at once &#8211; that is too much change to manage and it introduces risk. Because of it&#8217;s interoperability with all of these platforms, introducing Contrail will allow an organization to stitch together their virtualization/container platforms on their terms as their infrastructure evolves with the applications that sit atop it.</p>
<p>Check out how Contrail integrates with VMware, OpenStack, Kubernetes and OpenShift:</p>

<p>Recently, <a href="http://www.opencontrail.org/opencontrail-advisory-board-ocab/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">OpenContrail Advisory Board</a> (OCAB) members Edgar Magana, Cloud Operations Architect at Workday, Jakub Pavlik, CTO of tcpCloud, and Lachlan Evenson got together to discuss the state of the OpenContrail project as well as the fast-moving cloud industry. OCAB members guide the product now and into the future, and use it in their respective networks. In this 5-episode video series called <strong>Past, Present &amp; Future: Bridging the Boundaries of Digital World &amp; Beyond</strong>, Edgar, Jakub, and Lachlan share how important the OpenContrail community is, why they choose OpenContrail, how they solve ever-evolving networking problems, and what the future looks like in the SDN space.</p>
<p>When &#8220;SDN&#8221; became as hot as Pokemon Go five years ago, everyone knew it had great promise, but no one knew what to do with it. With the urge to create an open architecture that worked for all of their customers, Edgar, Jakub and Lachlan met in 2012 with the same desire to shift towards a software-centric network, but relied on each other and the community to test, implement, and troubleshoot their respective issues. With so many different technologies to test, and so many nuances in each unique implementation, OCAB members leveraged the community learn from each other and replicate success.</p>
<p>Find out in this first episode, how the community has flourished over the last few years, and what considerations OCAB members and their respective organizations took before adopting OpenContrail.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>OpenContrail 3.0 brings to the table an impressive series of new features and enhancements. Some of them are especially useful for Service Chaining – and not only for Virtual Network Functions (VNF), but also for Physical Network Functions (PNF). This article describes a subset of these new features.</p>
<h2><strong>Decoupling Network from Compute in Service Chaining</strong></h2>
<p>In previous OpenContrail versions, Contrail acts like a Nova client and triggers the spawning of VNFs in OpenStack. We call this model v1 service chaining. Now, OpenContrail 3.0 supports both v1 and v2 (new!) service chaining. In the new model Contrail only takes care of the networking piece, which makes it easier to chain network functions implemented on a variety of compute flavors (VMs, containers, physical appliances).</p>
<p>The way we implement v2 service chaining is through Port Tuples. Let’s introduce one key concept (the VMI) and then discuss what Port Tuples are and their motivation.</p>
<p>One of the reasons why OpenContrail is so flexible in adopting new compute flavors (different typical hypervisors, containers, bare metal servers, etc.) is the VM Interface (VMI) concept. OpenContrail uses the VMI object abstraction as a means to interconnect a heterogeneous compute environment to the overlay network. Thanks to this abstraction layer, many of the features that were originally made to work for VMs also work seamlessly for other compute flavors.</p>
<p>In OpenContrail 3.0 we go one step further and define a Port Tuple as an ordered set of VM Interfaces. A given Port Tuple is an ordered list of network interfaces connected to the same VM, or container, or physical appliance. By chaining port tuples, it possible to build a service chain out of heterogeneous network functions, some of them virtual (VMs, containers) and others physical. In summary, Port Tuples are to NFV what VM Interfaces are to overlay networking.</p>
<p>Disclaimer: One of the scenarios displayed in the video (bare metal servers connected to vrouter CPE) is not supported at the time of this writing. It is shown as a way to illustrate the power of the port tuple concept and a possibly upcoming feature.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wDRQq0pmln4" width="600" height="400" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<h2><strong>Service Chain Redundancy in Contrail</strong></h2>
<p>OpenContrail has recently boosted its control plane feature set in several ways. One of them is routing policies. If you are familiar with network operating systems like Junos or IOS XR, you have certainly experienced routing policies more than once. Well, in OpenContrail this feature works exactly in the same way. Thanks to routing policies, it is possible to filter and modify routes in a fine-grained manner, adding a much greater control plane flexibility within OpenContrail itself.</p>
<p>At the time of publication of this post, the infrastructure has been completely developed and routing policies can be applied to Service Instance interfaces (left, right). In other words, it is currently possible to do fine-grained route leaking through a Service Chain. And the same infrastructure can be used in the future for other purposes too.</p>
<p>Among other use cases, the currently available routing policy feature set allows for Service Chain Redundancy. You can have a primary service chain in data center #1 and the backup service chain in data center #2. Combined with the Service Health Check feature, Service Providers can easily implement HA on their NFV offerings.</p>
