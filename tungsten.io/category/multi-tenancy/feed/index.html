<h2>True Segmentation &amp; Faster TTM with Microservices</h2>
<div id="schema-videoobject" class="video-container"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JBSvIUe32vw?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0" width="550" height="340" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div>
<p>So, what are microservices, and why is everyone talking about them? Microservices are applications broken down into smaller, bite-size component. A microservices infrastructure means application deployment no longer takes months; it can take as little as 45 minutes. <strong>For our OCAB members, the value of a microservices architecture is one word: quick.</strong> Changes can be made quickly and pushed live in the same day. In fact, Lachlan said, “<strong>I saw one app that was deployed 100 times in a week</strong>” – unheard of before microservices. Developers don’t have to worry about runtime dependencies; they can focus on quality of code. And, containerizing microservices ensure that software can run reliably and at scale in different computing environments.</p>
<p>But Edgar, Jakub, and Lachlan experienced very poor networking for containers. They needed the <a href="https://t.co/2xXFyUSHMM" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">network to support communication between containers</a>. According to Jakub, “<strong>when OpenContrail came into the game, we saw that [containers] were starting to be usable</strong>”. Then, he and others could actually scale web application front-ends into containers, store data in virtual machines on OpenStack, and federate the OpenContrail solution together.</p>
<p>Find out more on how Edgar, Jakub, and Lachie were able to achieve with lightweight, easy-to-update microservices. <strong>Don’t forget, this is just the beginning of application transformation.</strong></p>

<p>The goal that Edgar, Jakub, and Lachlan share, is to create for public cloud users, the same experience that private cloud users have: peace of mind that their information is secure. But first, they tackle the issue of helping their customers migrate their IT infrastructure to the cloud with continuous communication. They need technology that gives them granular visibility and control over security policies over every workload, whether those workloads are on bare-metal server, or in a virtualized environment. They need to have visibility into and control over everything down to the network level.</p>
<p>These providers want to provide a consistently secure experience for their users across cloud providers that’s fully automated (no manual configuration of static VPNs). They turned to <a href="https://www.juniper.net/assets/us/en/local/pdf/solutionbriefs/3510582-en.pdf?utm_source=OCAB_Panel&amp;utm_medium=Youtube&amp;utm_campaign=SolutionBrief" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">OpenContrail</a> to implement secure virtual overlay networks to logically separate departments, and integrate virtualized workloads in both public and private clouds. Using standards-based protocols, OpenContrail allows enterprises to use their existing physical infrastructure (supporting BGP) for their on-prem infrastructure.</p>
