										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By: Szymon Golebiewski (TSC Chair)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m pleased to announce that earlier this year, I was elected to be the new TSC Chair for Tungsten Fabric. First, I’d like to thank the outgoing TSC Chair Prabhjot Sethi, who did a great job leading the community and advancing the project. Second, I’d like to congratulate the other TSC Board Members elected last spring that can be seen </span><a href="https://tungsten.io/community/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ve been working with Tungsten Fabric now for several years, leading the teams responsible for Contrail Command and Contrail Multicloud, as PTL for Tungsten Fabric documentation, and developing a sense for the possibilities and limitations of open source software development. One of my main objectives is to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">help grow Tungsten Fabric as a fully transparent open source project.</span></p>

<p>By: VM Brasseur</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignleft size-large is-resized"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://tungsten.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/73/2020/05/OctoCat_from_CC.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-8320" width="344" height="459" srcset="https://tungsten.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/73/2020/05/OctoCat_from_CC.jpg 307w, https://tungsten.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/73/2020/05/OctoCat_from_CC-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 344px) 100vw, 344px" /><figcaption>&#8220;Octocat&#8221; by Philippe Lin is licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 2.0</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>One of the benefits of open source communities is the ability to collaborate across organizations and choose the platforms and tooling best suited to the goals of the project. Recently, the Tungsten Fabric community decided to migrate its repositories from Gerrit to GitHub. The work has already started and we&#8217;re excited to execute this migration over the proceeding months. We&#8217;re learning a lot along the way and this post will be the first of a series to share our key findings and explain what this will mean for the community going forward.We hope the migration will fortify the project foundation for years to come and that these posts will be helpful to other open source communities facing similar challenges.</p>



<p>Before taking this step, the TF community took a data-driven approach to validate the feelings that many of us in the community have held for a long time, especially&nbsp; around tooling usability. The lifeblood of any open source project is the ability to attract and retain new developers and the usability of tools — especially at the beginning — can be a “make or break” for developers deciding where to focus their time and attention. Data we received from participating in Google’s Summer of Code program confirmed Gerrit usability issues for project newcomers and this helped shift the community towards a longer-term view.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, migrating repositories is a big deal and not something to take lightly. The migration impacts, along with a spider web of interdependencies, need to be mapped carefully. It turns out migration wasn’t possible at all until recently because TF’s former CI/CD system, Zuul, wouldn’t work the way we needed it to with GitHub. Once the decision was made to migrate CI/CD from Zuul to Jenkins the final obstacle to a GitHub transition disappeared. Prioritizing usability, the TF TSC made the official decision to migrate Gerrit to GitHub.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As power users of the platforms, TF chose the docs team to take the plunge first and help forge a path for the community to follow. Their role as project scribes naturally means that the process and workflow for migration will be chronicled clearly in Jira tickets, meeting minutes, and captured in the documentation itself.</p>



<p>The docs migration Beta will inform the overall TF repo migration plan and timeline. By rolling out the migration in stages, the community can benefit from lessons learned early on and make adjustments along the way. This reduces risk and builds familiarity for new processes among community members. For tooling, GitHub is of course already ubiquitous in the open source space. In fact, TF has been mirroring the Gerrit repos in GitHub already so that developers could more easily find the project, though contributions had to be made in Gerrit! Therefore, consolidation onto GitHub repos entirely reduces system complexity and allows contributors to work with just one platform.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Once through the migration process, the community is looking forward to a number of benefits, primarily:</p>



<ul><li>Improved usability</li><li>Easier discovery</li><li>Faster onboarding&nbsp;</li><li>Less complexity</li></ul>



<p>You can take a peek at the Docs work in progress on GitHub <a href="https://github.com/tungstenfabric/docs">here</a>. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><i>By Edward Ting</i></p>
<p>Along with other significant open source projects, Tungsten Fabric participated in the 2019 Network &amp; Compute Developer’s Conference (NCDC), in Beijing,  to rally community developers in the Greater China region.</p>
<p>Tungsten Fabric’s booth featured a wall-sized image of TF architecture as well our key “RULE THEM ALL WITH ONE” message. Next to it stood a  giant, stand-up Tungsten Fabric banner that traveled 6,000 miles with community member <a href="https://wiki.tungsten.io/display/~sukhdevkapur">Sukhdev Kapur</a>!</p>
<p>Following the morning session on the first day of the event, developers flocked to the booth, many asking what “multicloud multistack SDN” means. After a brief explanation, we invited attendees to join the TF workshop after lunch. And they showed up and filled the room starting 1:30pm.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-8165 alignleft" src="https://tungsten.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/73/2019/07/TF-blog-table-1-300x241.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="241" srcset="https://tungsten.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/73/2019/07/TF-blog-table-1-300x241.jpg 300w, https://tungsten.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/73/2019/07/TF-blog-table-1.jpg 907w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /> <img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-8166 aligncenter" src="https://tungsten.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/73/2019/07/TF-blog-2.png" alt="" width="270" height="180" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Highlights from The TF Workshop</b></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://wiki.tungsten.io/display/~sukhdevkapur">Sukhdev Kapur</a> started the workshop with a presentation entitled,  “Tungsten Fabric &amp; Akraino SDN and NFV for Edge,” followed by an interactive Q&amp;A session.</li>
<li>Raymond later presented on TF 5.1 features, with impressive animations of use cases showing live traffic and flow, which further demonstrated how TF can “RULE THEM ALL WITH ONE.”</li>
<li><a href="https://wiki.tungsten.io/display/~ocean1598">Edward Ting</a> walked through the TF 5.1 community release-building process, from source code to deployment, following the steps documented here: “<a href="https://wiki.tungsten.io/display/TUN/Building+a+Release">https://wiki.tungsten.io/display/TUN/Building+a+Release</a>.”The whole 2-hour build-time was condensed to 30 minutes in PPT!</li>
<li>The closing panel session featured  <a href="https://wiki.tungsten.io/display/~ocean1598">Edward Ting</a> as the moderator asking <a href="https://wiki.tungsten.io/display/~sukhdevkapur">Sukhdev Kapur</a> and Raymond questions about TF. The discussion ranged from ML2 plugin, VXLAN/MPLS tunnels, to VMware &amp; Ubuntu use cases. After this workshop, they plan to try TF 5.1 and hopefully join the community soon.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We&#8217;re very excited to introduce the two latest additions to the Tungsten Fabric community: Our Google Summer of Code (GSoC) interns!</p>
<p>Despite being a relatively young project[*], Tungsten Fabric (TF) received a lot of interest from GSoC applicants. After all the dust had settled from the initial flurry of questions we ended up with eight excellent candidates…but only two internships. While all of the applicants were great, our two new community members really impressed us with their knowledge and enthusiasm.</p>
<div id="attachment_8139" style="width: 160px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-8139" class="wp-image-8139 size-thumbnail" src="https://tungsten.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/73/2019/05/nishita_sikka-150x150.jpeg" alt="" width="150" height="150"><p id="caption-attachment-8139" class="wp-caption-text">Nishita Sikka</p></div>
<p><strong>Nishita Sikka</strong>&nbsp;will be working on the&nbsp;<a href="https://wiki.tungsten.io/display/TUN/GSoC+2019#GSoC2019-ExtendContrailAnsibleDeployertoSupportSoftwareUpgrades" rel="nofollow">Extend Contrail Ansible Deployer to Support Software Upgrades</a>&nbsp;project along with her mentor Darien Hirotsu from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.redapt.com/" rel="nofollow">Redapt</a>. She&#8217;s a graduate student at Northeastern University, studying computer system networking and telecommunications.</p>
<p><em>&#8220;As a part of my previous and current projects, I am exploring cloud technologies, automation tools, and networking. Making my way with Python and learning to integrate networking with automation I have learned a whole lot and would say this opportunity with GSOC would make this journey even better. Besides being super passionate about working on independent projects and practicing code, I enjoy sports and Crossfit.&#8221;</em></p>
<div id="attachment_8140" style="width: 160px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-8140" class="wp-image-8140 size-thumbnail" src="https://tungsten.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/73/2019/05/fayaz_akhtar-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150"><p id="caption-attachment-8140" class="wp-caption-text">Fayaz Akhtar</p></div>
<p><strong>Fayaz Akhtar</strong>&nbsp;will be working on the&nbsp;<a href="https://wiki.tungsten.io/display/TUN/GSoC+2019#GSoC2019-QuickstartScriptsforTungstenfabricinKubernetes" rel="nofollow">Quickstart Scripts for Tungsten fabric in Kubernetes</a>&nbsp;project along with his mentor Syed Ahmed from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cloudops.com/" rel="nofollow">CloudOps</a>. He&#8217;s a PhD candidate at Waterford Institute of Technology, studying the use of machine learning in software defined networks.</p>
<p><em>&#8220;I have mostly been exploring the theoretical side of SDN, trying to resolve existing challenges through an analytical approach. I am also an avid Python programmer and have used it for scrapping and automation projects. Besides reading up on the latest research taking place, I also enjoy cooking and playing FPS games&#8221;</em></p>
<p>We&#8217;re thrilled to have them join us and are looking forward to all of their contributions to the project and the community!</p>
<p>[*] Tungsten Fabric is only one and a half years old, but it owes a huge debt to its former incarnation of Open Contrail, which had five great years before handing over the reins to TF.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="500" height="178" src="https://tungsten.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/73/2019/03/TF-Blog-Image.png" alt="" class="wp-image-8109" srcset="https://tungsten.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/73/2019/03/TF-Blog-Image.png 500w, https://tungsten.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/73/2019/03/TF-Blog-Image-300x107.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></figure>



<p>A few short weeks ago, the Tungsten Fabric community received some exciting news: our community is officially a 2019 <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/">Google Summer of Code</a> (GSoC) organization. This is an awesome opportunity for Tungsten Fabric, and our community members can’t wait to get started. Given that, we wanted to take some time to share what this news means and why we are taking it seriously. Let’s make sure everyone in the Tungsten Fabric community is aware to ensure our first foray into GSoC program is an amazing success. First though, here is some background.</p>



<p><em>What is GSoC?﻿</em></p>



<p>GSoC is global program focused on connecting
students to open source organizations. <em>Global</em>
really is a key word in describing GSoC since students apply from all over the
planet. Google graciously provides <a href="https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/help/student-stipends">stipends</a> to incentivize
students to work hard and contribute to a variety of open source software
projects. Also, GSoC students operate independently of any company which allows
them to truly own their work and experience. Mentors from open source
communities actively engage GSoC students to ensure their success through the
project and to give them a foundation to jump start their careers.</p>



<p>Also, GSoC has a long history of <a href="https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/resources/stats">success</a>. Starting in
2005, GSoC has seen impressive growth including the latest contribution numbers
for 2018 shown below. </p>



<ul><li>2018
     GSoC Statistics<ul><li>Coding
      Dates: May 14th &#8211; August 14th</li><li>1,264
      students accepted from 62 countries</li><li>2,117
      mentors with active projects from 73 countries</li><li>206
      open source organizations</li><li>86.24%
      overall success rate</li></ul></li></ul>



<p><em>Why
is this so great?</em></p>



<p>Here are some reasons why the Tungsten Fabric
GSoC team is excited for the 2019 program.</p>



<ul><li>Our projects cover skillsets for a wide variety of future industry
professionals.<ul><li>Clearly code is at the forefront of GSoC. That said, some of the
projects have a heavy networking focus (<a href="https://www.segment-routing.net/">Segment Routing</a>). Some require
knowledge of distributed systems (<a href="http://cassandra.apache.org/">Cassandra</a>). We have
something for everyone! See our <a href="https://wiki.tungsten.io/display/TUN/GSoC+2019">project list</a> for more
information.</li></ul></li><li>Being accepted as an organization is a privilege.<ul><li>GSoC is a <a href="https://google.github.io/gsocguides/student/being-turned-down">competitive program</a>. Being accepted
as a student or an organization is a privilege.</li></ul></li><li>There is a diverse group of open source communities that participate.<ul><li>The <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/organizations/">2019 GSoC
organizations</a> is a diverse mix of open source projects that over a wide variety
of use cases and technologies.</li></ul></li><li>As Tungsten Fabric members, we all want to see community diversity
and growth.<ul><li>All contributions are valuable, so we can’t wait to onboard new
members into Tungsten Fabric.</li></ul></li></ul>



<p><em>Am I
eligible?</em></p>



<p>If you read this far, hopefully you are getting
excited about participating! Note that you do need to be an active student in
an accredited university to participate in GSoC. That said, if you don’t
qualify or you don’t feel like you can participate this year, start planning
for next year. Remember that GSoC is competitive, and it requires planning. Additional
information on eligibility can be found <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/get-started/">here</a>.</p>



<p><em>Kudos
to the GSoC Team</em></p>



<p>Special thanks to our GSoC volunteer,
participants who made this happen.</p>



<p>Vicky Brasseur: GSoC Admin</p>



<p>Valentin Sintisin, Syed Ahmed, Darien Hirotsu:
GSoC Mentors</p>



<p><em>How
do I learn more and how do I get started?</em></p>



<p>GSoC has a lot of great references and
resources for <a href="https://google.github.io/gsocguides/student/index">students</a> and <a href="https://google.github.io/gsocguides/mentor/">mentors</a> to make sure everyone
knows what is expected. 



To learn more about our
GSoC projects, take a look at our <a href="https://wiki.tungsten.io/display/TUN/GSoC+2019">project page</a> to see what we are working on. Here are some
tips on <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/organizations/4760172386320384/">how to get engaged</a>. For prospective students, put a reminder on
your calendars for April 9<sup>th</sup>; that’s when all GSoC applications are
due! We look forward to seeing you all on our <a href="https://lists.tungsten.io/">message boards</a> and <a href="https://tungstenfabric.slack.com/join/shared_invite/enQtMzM0MjMyMDIzMzk3LTZjM2JmMWZlOGMyM2RlZDAxM2RiYjE0YWZlMTAyYWIzYmNmYmY4MTc5MzIzNjk5YWY2N2JmNzIzNzJlZmMzMzU">Slack channel</a>.

<p>At the most recent Tungsten Fabric developer summit in Seattle at KubeCon, community members gathered to map out new features and exchange use case best practices. Four of the event participants gathered over lunch, so we dropped a mic on the table and recorded their thoughts for the community to hear. <br></p>



<p>Valentine Sinitsyn of Yandex, Randy Bias of Juniper, Will Stevens of Cloudops, and Darien Hirotsu of Redapt shared their thoughts on:<br></p>



<ul><li>Tungsten Fabric vs Canal (Calico + Flannel): When to use which and why, and how they fit into the Kubernetes ecosystem; bridging the gap between legacy networks and cloud with Tungsten Fabric and Kubernetes.</li><li>Tungsten Fabric and service meshes: L2 and L3 versus L7 for service meshes. Will they meet in the middle or overlap? </li><li>Tungsten Fabric and Serverless: Can you bring up a port in 100ms? Tungsten can do serverless and bare metal and containers and more. Are there other ways to do this? What’s the positive impact of having refactored the Tungsten Fabric control plane in Kubernetes?</li><li>Tungsten Fabric and DevOps/NetOps: Are all the options and choices in Tungsten Fabric good for DevOps or bad? What are the advantages of a consistent networking plane that’s abstracted away from the underlay?</li></ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>Shanghai (KubeCon + CloudNativeCon China) — Nov. 13, 2018</b> –The <a href="https://www.lfnetworking.org/">LF Networking</a> Fund (LFN), which facilitates collaboration and operational excellence across networking projects, today announced the new Tungsten Fabric Performance Lab. Launched jointly by Intel, Juniper Networks, Lenovo and SDNLAB, the Performance Lab aims to forge an open source test and verification environment for Tungsten Fabric and other Software Defined Networks (SDN) projects.</p>
<p>Tungsten Fabric is an open source, scalable, multi-cloud, multistack networking platform. It provides a single point of control, observability and analytics for networking and security. Tungsten Fabric is integrated with private cloud stacks including Kubernetes, VMware and OpenStack. It also supports hybrid deployments with public clouds including AWS and GCE.</p>
<p>“Continuous integration and automated testing are critical pieces for any environment supporting edge use cases, especially in highly distributed production environments,” said Randy Bias, vice president, Technology – Open Source Software at Juniper Networks. “When you consider the diversity of vendors and use cases in edge, the testing and integration problem is even more acute. Tungsten Fabric Performance Lab will provide the infrastructure and tooling that both vendors and users need to deliver reliable and performant applications and network services, from the core to the edge.”</p>
<p>The goal of the Tungsten Fabric Performance Lab is to build a Continuous Integration (CI) and automatic test environment for Tungsten Fabric functional and performance indicators, including key usage scenarios such as edge computing, multiple cloud and switch integration. By working collaboratively with software and hardware partners across the ecosystem to define the key service scheme, the goal is to help accelerate commercial deployments.</p>
<p>Hosted by LFN Associate member SDNLAB, the lab is based in in Nanjing, China, and will be integrated as Tungsten Fabric Lab infrastructure. This joins other Linux Foundation open labs in the region,  including OPNFV Pharos Labs in Shanghai, Xi’an, and Beijing (hosted by China Mobile, Huawei, and ZTE). Linux Foundation’s <a href="https://www.dpdk.org/">Data Dlane Development Kit </a>(DPDK), the Intel® Select Solution for NFVI based Lenovo ThinkSystem servers will be seamlessly integrated into Tungsten Fabric’s CI to support Tungsten Fabric’s bare-metal, SmartNIC performance testing.</p>
<p>SDNLAB is a leading independent digital service platform in China providing the daily news, technology analysis, industry insights, lab and education content service for networking and Information technology.  SDNLAB is part of FNII (Future Network Innovation Institute), a joint research institute granted with state fund, deep collaboration with the Chinese Academy of Sciences and leading universities such as Tsinghua University and BUPT, CETC.</p>
<p>Any interested parties are cordially invited to participate in the Tungsten Fabric Performance Lab to help enhance a broad ecosystem. More details on how to participate are available at <a href="https://wiki.tungsten.io/display/TUN/Open+Lab">https://wiki.tungsten.io/display/TUN/Open+Lab</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year, we mapped out a comprehensive game plan and led the community in executing that plan to evolve OpenContrail to something more than a Juniper-led effort.  We want it to be more broadly deployed than just carriers and service providers. Core to that plan was growing and diversifying the developer base beyond Juniper Networks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the ONS Summit in Los Angeles today, we </span><a href="https://www.linuxfoundation.org/press-release/opencontrail-is-now-tungsten-fabric-completes-move-to-the-linux-foundation/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">announced two big milestones</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in that effort. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First, our migration to the </span><a href="http://www.linuxfoundation.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Linux Foundation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is complete. Since </span><a href="http://www.datacenterdynamics.com/content-tracks/open-data-center/juniper-transfers-opencontrail-project-to-the-linux-foundation/99493.fullarticle"><span style="font-weight: 400;">December</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, we’ve been working with the LF to address gating functions like charter docs, infrastructure management, and CLAs. Completing this move is important in that it gives our community a standard set of governance and licensing practices that are shared by many other open source initiatives.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Second, as part of this migration, the name of our project has been changed to </span><a href="https://tungsten.io/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tungsten Fabric</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Juniper Networks will retain the trademarks for its Juniper Contrail product line, so changing the name to Tungsten Fabric helps us avoid any market confusion over which is the commercial product and which is the open source project.  It also opens the door to other commercial distributions all “powered by” the same open source project: Tungsten Fabric.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re also working with the LF Networking (LFN) board to move Tungsten Fabric into that networking umbrella organization. LFN was formed to curate a set of open networking projects into a sub-community, similar conceptually to the CNCF. By collaborating with the other LFN projects—ONAP, OPNFV, OpenDaylight, FD.io, DPDK, SNAS and PNDA—our community can more quickly respond to emerging use cases and resolve cross-project technical issues. We’ll keep you posted on this process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, Tungsten Fabric will remain a critical part of Juniper’s strategy around cloud-grade networking, delivering on the promises of open and scalable multicloud networking options. Placing the codebase and community at the LF is a proof point showing Juniper’s commitment to open networking and open source more generally.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tungsten Fabric has an opportunity to become a ubiquitous, cloud-grade network fabric that’s agnostic to underlay infrastructure and able to extend across all cloud infrastructure. We want Tungsten Fabric to provide a single point of control, visibility, and management, globally or through open standards-based federation, for all networks and network security. It will become the most broadly adopted and highest quality SDN technology available when we deliver on that vision.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A lot is happening this week at ONS to make that vision real. The Tungsten Fabric community is here in force, talking about project status, use cases, and major roadmap initiatives. One major feature addition being discussed yesterday at the </span><a href="https://onsna18.sched.com/type/opencontrail+mini-summit"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tungsten Fabric Mini-Summit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was the development of controller features to orchestrate EVPN in data center network fabrics. In short, the project is evolving beyond its network overlay roots.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tungsten Fabric is the most widely deployed scalable, multicloud networking platform. We’ve got a great base to work from as we add new capabilities in collaboration with communities we’re already integrated with, including Kubernetes, Mesos, VMware and OpenStack. Tungsten Fabric users can already cover the waterfront: private cloud, hybrid cloud and major public clouds are already supported. Tungsten Fabric includes a high performance vRouter that connects container, VM and bare-metal applications, and a controller to orchestrate network overlays, switch fabrics and router gateways.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In short, Tungsten Fabric already lives up to the traits its name suggests: It’s strong, high-performance, and can handle the heat from running at scale in some of the world’s largest carrier environments with demanding networking requirements. Now, we’ll turn our attention to building on that base to bring Tungsten Fabric to the enterprise and to the edge.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This post would not be complete without a shout out to the contributors and community members who have helped build the community and guide this evolution: Aricent, AT&amp;T, Bell, Cavium, CertusNet, CloudOps, CodiLime, Intel, Juniper Networks, Lenovo, Mellanox, Mirantis, Netronome, Orange, SDNEssentials, TechTrueUp and Yandex. It’s a  community of powerful networking brands, and it’s growing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now is the time to get on board and get engaged with the Tungsten Fabric community. Join us on Slack (tungstenfabric.slack.com) and follow us on Twitter (</span><a href="http://www.twitter.com/tungstenfabric"><span style="font-weight: 400;">www.twitter.com/tungstenfabric</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The world demands a truly global network fabric, one that works well for carrier-cloud scale, enterprises, and at the edge. Tungsten Fabric is becoming that network fabric, and we invite you to join us on the road ahead.</span></p>
