The control and management components were packaged into 4 containers, and the vRouter\u2019s kernel module deployment is container-enabled too.<\/p>\n<p>This new canonical way to deploy OpenContrail was eagerly anticipated, simplifying the day-1 user experience. News of the package refactoring was revealed in a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.opencontrail.org\/container-networking-made-simple-with-opencontrail-and-kubernetes\/\">past blog<\/a> that also covered integration with Kubernetes. The formal software containerization support in Juniper\u2019s Contrail Networking followed this June in the release of version 4.0.<\/p>\n<p>The support of networking containers as endpoints came a while ago however. Some of us have been using it <a href=\"https:\/\/engineering.riotgames.com\/news\/running-online-services-riot-part-iii\">in production<\/a> and others have been musing with that support paired with Kubernetes; it\u2019s been 2^9 days since my early <a href=\"http:\/\/www.opencontrail.org\/getting-to-gifee-with-sdn-demo\/\">demo<\/a> of OpenContrail with Kubernetes and OpenShift (see the newer <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=LKL3vLErsvY&amp;t=43s\">demo<\/a> now).<\/p>\n<p>That original open-sourced demo was in fact using Docker container images that Juniper uploaded to Docker Hub way back for version 2.20. After none of the subsequent releases made it to Docker Hub, you may have been wondering if those images were a one-hit wonder: nope. While the community is rolling a CI\/CD <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/Juniper\/contrail-controller\/wiki\/OpenContrail-Continuous-Integration-(CI)\">pipeline<\/a> for OpenContrail\u2019s core elements, today\u2019s posting of the version 4.0.1 images is an intermediate step until that fully codifies.<\/p>\n<p>The containerization of the OpenContrail software itself, may understandably lead you to associate it with other container tools like CNI, Kubernetes, Mesos or OpenShift \u2013 all of which are supported \u2013 but it\u2019s worth noting that the containerized deployment is also used <a href=\"https:\/\/gitlab.com\/gokulpch\/OpenContrail-Kolla\/blob\/master\/README.md\">with OpenStack<\/a> Kolla. That being said, it\u2019s exciting to imagine the possibility of deploying OpenContrail containers directly on top of container orchestration platforms, bringing their features to bear to manage an OpenContrail deployment. This is exactly what\u2019s being planned with the help of Helm. In the meantime, it\u2019s still click-click easy with the server manager GUI, and equally simple with <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/Juniper\/contrail-ansible\">Ansible<\/a>, which also affords you the opportunity to deploy your SDN as code a la DevNetOps, perhaps upholding your application stack and DevOps; now there\u2019s a dynamic duo!<\/p>\n<p>The new Docker Hub images shouldn\u2019t lower the barrier to entry, with any luck, they should remove it entirely. For example, if you\u2019re working with Kubernetes, you\u2019ve already done enough learning and lifting to get that going, and the hope is to keep you focused on that: until you want to dig into SDN, the OpenContrail networking and security features just work. To make that a reality, the download and <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/Juniper\/contrail-docker\/wiki\/Provision-Contrail-CNI-for-Kubernetes\">installation of OpenContrail<\/a> needs to be simple and steady, and then get out of your way. Hopefully that\u2019s what you\u2019ll find.
