It will then query the OpenContrail analytics REST API server to extract the floating IP statistics associated with those virtual machines and floating IPs and populate the meters. Similarly for the virtual network meters, the driver will query neutron\/nova to obtain the list of networks and then query the OpenContrail analytics REST API server to extract the inter and intra virtual network statistics and populate the meters.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>More detail about the plug-in is available from the github wiki:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/Juniper\/contrail-controller\/wiki\/Ceilometer-and-OpenContrail-Driver-Enhancements\">https:\/\/github.com\/Juniper\/contrail-controller\/wiki\/Ceilometer-and-OpenContrail-Driver-Enhancements<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Talligent supports the decision of the Contrail team to integrate with Ceilometer for a couple of key reasons:<\/p>\n<p>1) This plug-in extends the value of Ceilometer as a funnel for key metrics about the OpenStack environment; and<\/p>\n<p>2) the community benefits from being able to use the common Ceilometer API to pick up this new information.\u00a0 This initiative is additional validation that Ceilometer will be the primary telemetry module for OpenStack.<\/p>\n<p>Openbook v2.5 is tested to work with the Juniper Networks Contrail Cloud and the OpenContrail Ceilometer Driver.<\/p>\n<p>If you are interested in learning more about the use of OpenContrail and the OpenContrail Ceilometer Driver to bill and report on bandwidth metrics in Openstack, please contact Talligent at <a href=\"mailto:openbook@talligent.com\">openbook@talligent.com<\/a> for more information.<\/p>\n<p><strong>About Talligent<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Talligent empowers enterprises and service providers to deploy production ready OpenStack clouds by dramatically improving the visibility and control of cloud infrastructure consumption.
