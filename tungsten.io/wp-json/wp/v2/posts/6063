The extraordinary take away for me was that 82% of surveyed organizations say that their sights are set on hybrid cloud.<\/p>\n<p>If you don\u2019t understand WHY this is happening, have a look at my blog entry on <a href=\"http:\/\/forums.juniper.net\/t5\/SDN-Era\/From-Private-to-Multi-to-Hybrid-Cloud-in-the-Enterprise-What-Why\/ba-p\/253241\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>hybrid cloud:<\/strong> what why and how<\/a>with plenty of cross-referenced articles.<\/p>\n<p>This fundamentally bodes well for OpenStack, but we don\u2019t yet see it at 82% adoption\u2026why not? There is the obvious fud out there about OpenStack immaturity, but that is easily disproved by example. More importantly, I think there\u2019s still a lot of cloud-washing, but even with respect to hybrid cloud. Is this hybrid cloud end state as simple as using multiple private and public connected clouds? No, but I assure you there is a lot of that going on, and those folks saying they\u2019re hybridized. Getting to that point is great, but it is not the end game.<\/p>\n<p>To realize use cases like split-tier apps, split-tier storage (shout out to Google for their <a href=\"http:\/\/googlecloudplatform.blogspot.com\/2015\/03\/introducing-Google-Cloud-Storage-Nearline-near-online-data-at-an-offline-price.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">nearline storage<\/a> solution), multi-DC DA\/DR for multiple apps and storage, best venue cloud moves and cloud bursting, we need to get closer homogeneity (<strong>&#8211;<a href=\"http:\/\/forums.juniper.net\/t5\/SDN-Era\/From-Private-to-Multi-to-Hybrid-Cloud-in-the-Enterprise-What-Why\/ba-p\/253241\" target=\"_blank\">explanation<\/a>&#8211;<\/strong>) at the IaaS layer, and probably an iPaaS for higher-in-the-stack PaaS and SaaS integrations. At the IaaS it\u2019s a given that it\u2019s going to be OpenStack, otherwise you\u2019ll be in a small corner you\u2019ll have painted yourself into.<\/p>\n<p>If more folks needed to execute on these sophisticated use cases in short order, I predict the OpenStack adoption would spike. Alas, there are some IT orgs still fighting fires and keeping the lights on. As the wider IT \u201ctide\u201d rises to greater levels of automation, all the OpenStack \u201cboats\u201d will rise because of their amenability to the hybrid use cases (simple and sophisticated) on the broadest set of public clouds, providing the best outcomes in economics and choice. But this tide is rising slowly, and thus so is OpenStack. Things bode well for those notice it, less so for those that don\u2019t.<\/p>\n<p>Always happy to get comments below and reshares on social.
