Launched jointly by Intel, Juniper Networks, Lenovo and SDNLAB, the Performance Lab aims to forge an open source test and verification environment for Tungsten Fabric and other Software Defined Networks (SDN) projects.<\/p>\n<p>Tungsten Fabric is an open source, scalable, multi-cloud, multistack networking platform. It provides a single point of control, observability and analytics for networking and security. Tungsten Fabric is integrated with private cloud stacks including Kubernetes, VMware and OpenStack. It also supports hybrid deployments with public clouds including AWS and GCE.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cContinuous integration and automated testing are critical pieces for any environment supporting edge use cases, especially in highly distributed production environments,\u201d said Randy Bias, vice president, Technology \u2013 Open Source Software at Juniper Networks. \u201cWhen you consider the diversity of vendors and use cases in edge, the testing and integration problem is even more acute. Tungsten Fabric Performance Lab will provide the infrastructure and tooling that both vendors and users need to deliver reliable and performant applications and network services, from the core to the edge.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The goal of the Tungsten Fabric Performance Lab is to build a Continuous Integration (CI) and automatic test environment for Tungsten Fabric functional and performance indicators, including key usage scenarios such as edge computing, multiple cloud and switch integration. By working collaboratively with software and hardware partners across the ecosystem to define the key service scheme, the goal is to help accelerate commercial deployments.<\/p>\n<p>Hosted by LFN Associate member SDNLAB, the lab is based in in Nanjing, China, and will be integrated as Tungsten Fabric Lab infrastructure. This joins other Linux Foundation open labs in the region, \u00a0including OPNFV Pharos Labs in Shanghai, Xi\u2019an, and Beijing (hosted by China Mobile, Huawei, and ZTE).\u00a0Linux Foundation\u2019s\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.dpdk.org\/\">Data Dlane Development Kit\u00a0<\/a>(DPDK), the Intel\u00ae Select Solution for NFVI based Lenovo ThinkSystem servers will be seamlessly integrated into Tungsten Fabric\u2019s CI to support Tungsten Fabric\u2019s bare-metal, SmartNIC performance testing.<\/p>\n<p>SDNLAB is a leading independent digital service platform in China providing the daily news, technology analysis, industry insights, lab and education content service for networking and Information technology. \u00a0SDNLAB is part of FNII (Future Network Innovation Institute), a joint research institute granted with state fund, deep collaboration with the Chinese Academy of Sciences and leading universities such as Tsinghua University and BUPT, CETC.<\/p>\n<p>Any interested parties are cordially invited to participate in the Tungsten Fabric Performance Lab to help enhance a broad ecosystem.

We are delighted to contribute to the Linux Foundation\u2019s open source efforts as this will extend our academy\u2019s research strategy to connect directly with leading industry leading projects; the synergy will lead to turning \u00a0more innovative ideas into reality, via open source.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Rajesh Gadiyar, Vice President and CTO of Intel\u2019s Network Platforms Group (NPG) said, \u201cIntel is pleased to support this initiative, which will help drive faster innovation and adoption of Tungsten Fabric for a variety of use cases such as 5G and edge computing.\u00a0 By optimizing data throughput with the Intel\u00ae Select Solution for NFVI from Lenovo and the Data Plane Development Kit (DPDK), Tungsten Fabric\u2019s vRouter provides a high performance, production ready virtualized solution that connects a customer\u2019s application implemented with containers, virtual machines, and bare-metal environments.<\/p>\n<p>Randy Bias, vice president, Technology, Open Source Software at Juniper Networks, said, \u201cEnterprises are realizing that \u2018easy-to-deploy\u2019 can lead to \u2018uh-oh\u2019 moments when the time comes to scale out multi-cloud networking technology. The Tungsten Fabric community has made a commitment to delivering the tooling and services that make deploying this technology more straightforward and less time consuming. Launching the Tungsten Fabric Performance Lab is an important step in achieving that goal.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cLenovo is very excited to be a key participant in the launch of Tungsten Fabric Performance Lab, which will enable the ecosystem of vendors and users to validate interoperability, performance and scalability for real world deployment scenarios, like hybrid cloud and 5G, and will accelerate the adoption of Tungsten Fabric,\u201d said Ahmed Murad, director of Product Management, Networking and Telco at Lenovo Data Center Group. \u201cThrough this test lab, customers will be able to conduct interoperability testing to accelerate and ensure the success of future deployments of these technologies.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><b>About the Linux Foundation<\/b><\/p>\n<p>The Linux Foundation is the organization of choice for the world\u2019s top developers and companies build ecosystems that accelerate open technology development and commercial adoption. Together with the worldwide open source community, it is solving the hardest technology problems by creating the largest shared technology investment in history. Founded in 2000, The Linux Foundation today provides tools, training and events to scale any open source project, which together deliver an economic impact not achievable by any one company.
