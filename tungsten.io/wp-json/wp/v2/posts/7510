This also eliminates the need for kube-proxy which is a drag on the performance due to its constant reconfiguration of iptables NAT rules.<\/li>\n<li>Network Policy:\u00a0OpenContrail implements the\u00a0Kubernetes network policy objects\u00a0applied to pods. \u00a0This framework enables tenant and network isolation with constructs for micro-segmentation using custom security groups. It also provides capabilities to insert transparent network services such as firewalls, DPI etc.<\/li>\n<li>Ingress Controller:\u00a0Stock Kubernetes solution does not provide an implementation to support ingress load balancing for services. With OpenContrail this implementation comes standard which provides a solution with HAProxy.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The following video provides a view into how these features work with OpenContrail.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/KL0E4SaRCs0\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>This blog is co-authored by\u00a0Gokul Chandra Purnachandra Reddy and\u00a0Yuvaraja Mariappan from Juniper Networks.
