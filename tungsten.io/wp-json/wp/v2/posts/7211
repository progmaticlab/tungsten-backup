In the future, we&#8217;ll really have a full dashboard where a red light blinks and shows the problematic site, down to the VM, container, or wherever it is. Then, instead of having a team of engineers trying to break down the problem and bake a solution, Edgar, Jakub and Lachlan are looking forward to having <strong>machine learning on operational platforms<\/strong>. With it, they envision that the network finally be able to identify patterns within the millions of data logs, and start predicting when there might be\u00a0issues. <strong>It&#8217;s a big endeavor, but a step towards the mantra,\u00a0&#8220;automate the automator&#8221;, and self-healing networks.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>And if that wasn&#8217;t cool enough, our advisors talked to someone from a satellite company, and discussed the policy of interplanetary network. If you really think about it, there will be a communication problem. In response, Lachlan says, &#8220;<strong>What&#8217;s to say you don&#8217;t put your sensors on Mars, and when they&#8217;re terraforming it, you figure out how much oxygen is there through\u00a0your sensors?<\/strong>&#8220;.\u00a0You may laugh, but in two years, what\u2019s to say we aren\u2019t making these things reality?<\/p>\n<p><strong>With open source, you have the collective knowledge of the world.<\/strong> In the networking world, our OpenContrail advisory board members are here to help solve problems to enable scientists, the medical field\u00a0&#8211;\u00a0you name it, we&#8217;ll solve it. Everything we&#8217;ve discussed in this 5-episode video series is\u00a0just the beginning. Here are some\u00a0closing thoughts from our OpenContrail Advisory Board Members Edgar, Jakub, and Lachlan:<\/p>\n<p>On OpenContrail &#8211; \u201c<strong>Fully reliable and production ready SDN solution that provides the best of two worlds, an open-source culture and a mature productized technology<\/strong>\u201d &#8211; Edgar Magana,\u00a0Cloud Operations Architect at Workday<\/p>\n<p>On open source: &#8220;<strong>A<\/strong><strong>n open source community is your force multiplier, creating collaborative spaces enables the delivery of better software, faster<\/strong>.&#8221; &#8211; Lachlan Evenson, Video Series Moderator<\/p>\n<p>On OpenContrail enabling end-to-end IoT &#8211; &#8220;<strong>This is exactly what we wanted to do: be able to build end-to-end solution where you can put the part [e.g. sensor] into lamps on a city-street\u00a0and the second part is in the cloud. We connect these open source solutions, and then we provide this separation, multi-tenancy, automatic connection of these networks no manual configuration of static VPNs but automated solution.
