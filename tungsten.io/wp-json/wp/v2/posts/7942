Core to that plan was growing and diversifying the developer base beyond Juniper Networks.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the ONS Summit in Los Angeles today, we <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.linuxfoundation.org\/press-release\/opencontrail-is-now-tungsten-fabric-completes-move-to-the-linux-foundation\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">announced two big milestones<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in that effort. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First, our migration to the <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.linuxfoundation.org\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Linux Foundation<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is complete. Since <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.datacenterdynamics.com\/content-tracks\/open-data-center\/juniper-transfers-opencontrail-project-to-the-linux-foundation\/99493.fullarticle\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">December<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, we\u2019ve been working with the LF to address gating functions like charter docs, infrastructure management, and CLAs. Completing this move is important in that it gives our community a standard set of governance and licensing practices that are shared by many other open source initiatives.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Second, as part of this migration, the name of our project has been changed to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/tungsten.io\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tungsten Fabric<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Juniper Networks will retain the trademarks for its Juniper Contrail product line, so changing the name to Tungsten Fabric helps us avoid any market confusion over which is the commercial product and which is the open source project. \u00a0It also opens the door to other commercial distributions all \u201cpowered by\u201d the same open source project: Tungsten Fabric.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We\u2019re also working with the LF Networking (LFN) board to move Tungsten Fabric into that networking umbrella organization. LFN was formed to curate a set of open networking projects into a sub-community, similar conceptually to the CNCF. By collaborating with the other LFN projects\u2014ONAP, OPNFV, OpenDaylight, FD.io, DPDK, SNAS and PNDA\u2014our community can more quickly respond to emerging use cases and resolve cross-project technical issues. We\u2019ll keep you posted on this process.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Of course, Tungsten Fabric will remain a critical part of Juniper\u2019s strategy around cloud-grade networking, delivering on the promises of open and scalable multicloud networking options. Placing the codebase and community at the LF is a proof point showing Juniper\u2019s commitment to open networking and open source more generally.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tungsten Fabric has an opportunity to become a ubiquitous, cloud-grade network fabric that\u2019s agnostic to underlay infrastructure and able to extend across all cloud infrastructure. We want Tungsten Fabric to provide a single point of control, visibility, and management, globally or through open standards-based federation, for all networks and network security. It will become the most broadly adopted and highest quality SDN technology available when we deliver on that vision.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A lot is happening this week at ONS to make that vision real. The Tungsten Fabric community is here in force, talking about project status, use cases, and major roadmap initiatives. One major feature addition being discussed yesterday at the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/onsna18.sched.com\/type\/opencontrail+mini-summit\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tungsten Fabric Mini-Summit<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> was the development of controller features to orchestrate EVPN in data center network fabrics. In short, the project is evolving beyond its network overlay roots.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tungsten Fabric is the most widely deployed scalable, multicloud networking platform. We\u2019ve got a great base to work from as we add new capabilities in collaboration with communities we\u2019re already integrated with, including Kubernetes, Mesos, VMware and OpenStack. Tungsten Fabric users can already cover the waterfront: private cloud, hybrid cloud and major public clouds are already supported. Tungsten Fabric includes a high performance vRouter that connects container, VM and bare-metal applications, and a controller to orchestrate network overlays, switch fabrics and router gateways.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In short, Tungsten Fabric already lives up to the traits its name suggests: It\u2019s strong, high-performance, and can handle the heat from running at scale in some of the world\u2019s largest carrier environments with demanding networking requirements. Now, we\u2019ll turn our attention to building on that base to bring Tungsten Fabric to the enterprise and to the edge.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This post would not be complete without a shout out to the contributors and community members who have helped build the community and guide this evolution: Aricent, AT&amp;T, Bell, Cavium, CertusNet, CloudOps, CodiLime, Intel, Juniper Networks, Lenovo, Mellanox, Mirantis, Netronome, Orange, SDNEssentials, TechTrueUp and Yandex. It\u2019s a \u00a0community of powerful networking brands, and it\u2019s growing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now is the time to get on board and get engaged with the Tungsten Fabric community. Join us on Slack (tungstenfabric.slack.com) and follow us on Twitter (<\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.twitter.com\/tungstenfabric\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">www.twitter.com\/tungstenfabric<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">)<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The world demands a truly global network fabric, one that works well for carrier-cloud scale, enterprises, and at the edge. Tungsten Fabric is becoming that network fabric, and we invite you to join us on the road ahead.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Last year, we mapped out a comprehensive game plan and led the community in executing that plan to evolve OpenContrail to something more than a Juniper-led effort. \u00a0We want it&#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":497,"featured_media":7945,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"footnotes":""},"categories":[42],"tags":[],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v21.6 -
