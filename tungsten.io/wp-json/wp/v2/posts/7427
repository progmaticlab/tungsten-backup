With title of \u201c#1 SDN for OpenStack\u201d secured for the last two years, the OpenContrail community is now ready for Kubernetes (K8s), the hottest stack out there, and a passion of mine for which I\u2019ve been advocating for more and more of attention around the office at Juniper.<\/p>\n<p>It couldn\u2019t be better timing, heading into KubeCon \/ CloudNativeCon \/ OpenShift Commons in Berlin this week. For those that know me, you know I love the (b)leading edge of cloud and devops, and last year when I built an AWS cluster for OpenContrail + OpenShift \/ Kubernetes then shared it in my Getting to #GIFEE <a href=\"http:\/\/jameskelly.net\/blog\/2016\/4\/7\/getting-to-gifee-with-sdn-demo\">blog<\/a>, github repo, and demo video, those were early days for OpenContrail in the K8s space. It was work pioneered by OpenContrail co-founder and a few star engineers to help me cut through the off-piste mank and uncharted territory. It was also inspired by my friends at tcp cloud (now Mirantis) who <a href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/_L_pR6ZYwEs\">presented<\/a> on Smart cities \/ IoT with K8s, OpenContrail, and Raspberry Pi at the last KubeCon EU. Today, OpenContrail, <em>the<\/em> all-capability open SDN is ready to kill it in the Kubernetes and OpenShift spaces, elevating it to precisely what I recently demo shopped for in skis: a true all-mountain top performer (BTW my vote goes to the Rosi Exp. HD 88). Now that you know what I was doing when not blogging recently\u2026 Skiing aside, our demos are ready for the KubeCon audience this week at our Juniper booth, and I\u2019ll be there talking about bringing a ton of extra value to the Kubernetes v1.6 networking stack.<\/p>\n<p>What sets OpenContrail apart from the other networking options for Kubernetes and OpenShift is that it brings an arsenal of networking and security features to bear on your stack, developed by years of the performance-obsessed folks at Juniper and many other engineers in the community. In this space OpenContrail often competes with smaller SDN solutions offered by startups. Their said advantage is positioned as nimbler and simpler solutions. This was particularly true in their easy, integrated installation with K8s (coming for OpenContrail very soon), but on the whole, their advantage, in general across the likes of Contiv, Calico, Flannel, Weave, etc. boils down to 2 things. Let\u2019s have a look\u2026<\/p>\n<p>First, it is easy to be simpler when primitive. This isn\u2019t a knock on the little guys. They are very good for some pointed use cases and indeed they are simple to use. They do have real limits however. Simple operation can always come from less knobs and fewer capabilities, but I believe an important goal of SDN, self-driving infrastructure, cognitive \/ AI in tech, is abstraction; in other words, simplicity needn\u2019t come from striping away functionality. We only need start with a good model for excellent performance at scale and design for elegance and ease of use. It\u2019s not easy to do, but have you noticed that Kubernetes itself is the perfect example of this? \u2013 super easy 2 years ago, still is, but at the same time there\u2019s a lot more to it today. It\u2019s built on solid concepts and architecture, from a lot of wisdom at Google. Abstraction is the new black. It\u2019s open, layered and transparent when you need to peel it back, and it is the solution to manage complexity that arises from features and concepts that aren\u2019t for everyone. General arguments aside, if you look at something like K8s ingress or services networking \/ balancing, none of the SDN solutions cover that except for very pointed solutions like GKE or nginx where you\u2019d still need one or more smaller SDN tools. Furthermore, when you start to demand network performance on the control (protocol\/API) and data (traffic feeds &amp; speeds) planes with scale in many other K8s metrics, the benefits of OpenContrail that you get for free really stand apart from the defacto K8s networking components and these niche offerings. Better still, you get it all as one OpenContrail solution that is portable across public and private clouds.<\/p>\n<p>Second, other solutions are often solely focused on K8s or CaaS stacks. OpenContrail is an SDN solution that isn\u2019t <em>just<\/em> for Kubernetes nor containers. It\u2019s one ring to rule them all. It works on adjacent CaaS stack integrations with OpenShift, Mesos, etc., but it\u2019s equally if not more time-tested in VMware and OpenStack stacks and even bare-metal or DIY orchestration of mixed runtimes. You might have heard of publicized customer cases for CaaS, VMware and OpenStack across hybrid clouds and continuing with the same OpenContrail networking irrespective of stacking PaaS and CaaS upon pub\/prvt IaaS or metal (here are a few <a href=\"https:\/\/engineering.riotgames.com\/news\/running-online-services-riot-part-iii\" target=\"_blank\">1<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=3SgDcIFiZQI\" target=\"_blank\">2<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.opencontrail.org\/videos\/\" target=\"_blank\">3<\/a>). It\u2019s one solution unifying your stack integration, network automation and policy needs across everything. In other words, the only-one-you-need all-mountain ski. The only competitor that comes close to this breadth is Nuage Networks, but they get knocked out quickly for not being open source (without tackling other important performance and scale detail here). If the right ski for the conditions sounds more fun to you, like the right tool for the right job, then wait for my next blog on hybrid cloud\u2026and what I spoke about at IBM Interconnect (sorry no recording). In short, while having lots of skis may have an appeal to different conditions, having lots of networking solutions is a recipe for IT disaster because the network foundation is so pervasive and needs to connect everything.<\/p>\n<p>With OpenContrail developers now making it is dead easy to deploy with K8s (think kubeadm, Helm, Ansible\u2026) and seamless to operate with K8s, it\u2019s going to do what it did for OpenStack networking, for Kubernetes networking very quickly. I\u2019m really excited to be a part of it.<\/p>\n<p>You can visit the Juniper booth to find me and hear more. As you may know, Juniper is the leading contributor to OpenContrail, but we\u2019re also putting K8s to work in the Juniper customer service workbench and CSO product (NFV\/CPE offering). Moreover, and extremely complementary to Juniper\u2019s Contrail Networking (our OpenContrail offering), Juniper just acquired AppFormix 4 months ago. AppFormix is smart operations management software that will make your OpenStack or K8s cluster ops akin to a self-driving Tesla (a <em>must<\/em> if your ops experience is about as much fun as a traffic jam). Juniper\u2019s AppFormix will give you visibility into the state of workloads both apps and software-defined infrastructure stack components alike, and it applies big data and cognitive machine learning to automate and adapt policies, alarms, chargebacks and more. AppFormix is my new jam (with Contrail PB)\u2026 it gathers and turns your cloud ops data into insight\u2026 The better and faster you can do that, the better your competitive advantage.
